Stock analysis for Steve's parents

# Challenge
I recommend Steve's parents not purchase green energy stock at this time as the returns for almost all green energy stocks for 2018 were very poor. I agree with Steve that his parents should diversify their investments. If they insist on investing in a green energy company, then both ENPH and RUN seem to be good investments as they have both had positive returns in 2017 and 2018.
